# Mybrary  
A simple library application where it is possible to add authors & books.  

## Tech stack
This is a dynamic web application created with express & mongodb. Focus here was in practicing MVC pattern, setting up routes and learning to use a view-engine. It reminded me a lot of my Python exam project which was built with Flask framework.  
I also got more practice in working with environment variables, and making use of Filepond library for uploading book images.

## Page  
This app is hosted via Render as a Web Service, and can be found here: https://nodejs-express-mongodb-library.onrender.com/

The database is hosted on mongodb atlas.
